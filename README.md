# MarketLang
this repository is for the MarketLang project, a esoteric programming language that is based on the stock market.
The main idea of this language is to create a kind of programming language that has some of the same properties as the stock market.
In practise this means that you have a "stock market" where you can buy and sell "stocks" that are actually instructions.
The value of the stock is based on how many times it has been bought and sold, and the value of the stock is the value of the instruction that the stock represents.
You also have to rent variables, and the rent is based on the value of the variable.

## Instructions
You may find the detailed list of instructions in the [docs.md](docs.md) file.

## Examples
You may find some examples in the [examples.md](examples.md) folder.

## GUI
you may use the included web interface to run MarketLang code.
Special thanks to [Jakub Šťastný](https://github.com/StastnyJ) for creating the GUI.
