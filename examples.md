# Examples
this file contains some examples of how to use the MLang language. You may use these examples to learn how to use the language or to test your own code.

## Hello, World!
```mlang
print Hello, World!
```

## Variables
this code creates a variable and assigns a value to it. then, it adds them together and prints the result.
```mlang
VAR0 = 5
VAR1 = 10
VAR0 += VAR1
print VAR1
```

## If statement
this code creates a variable and assigns a value to it. then, it checks if the value is greater than 10 and prints the result.
```mlang
VAR0 = 5
if VAR0 > 10
print VAR0 is greater than 10
if VAR0 <= 10
print VAR0 is less than or equal to 10
```

## For loop
this code creates a variable and assigns a value to it. then, it prints the value and increments it by 1. this is repeated 10 times.
```mlang
VAR0 = 0
block start
print hello world
VAR0 ++
if VAR0 != 10
goto start
```
